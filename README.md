# Team Self-Assessment Tool

A React-based web application that allows teams to assess their performance across five key domains: Strategic Focus, Change Maker, Inclusive, Collaborative, and Entrepreneurial.

## Overview

This tool enables teams to evaluate their capabilities through a series of questions in each domain. Team members can rate their performance using a traffic light system (Strength, Developing, Needs Growth), and results are visualized in a radar chart.

## Features

- **Domain-based Assessment**: Structured evaluation across five key domains
- **Traffic Light Rating System**: Simple 3-level scoring (Strength, Developing, Needs Growth)
- **Real-time Visualization**: Dynamic radar chart updates as ratings are entered
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
